//Inherited from Joule the art car

//This provides a layer of abstraction between fixtures and outputs.
//
//The base class LXAbstractFixture assumes that pixels are added in the exact
//physical order as the structure.
//This class provides a couple advantages:
//1. More flexibility in the creation of the fixture.  Points do not have to be added in order.
//2. The fixture can skip a pixel position if desired.
// -One use of this is to allow the fixture's configuration to contain information regarding bad, ie skipped, pixels.

	//Override this to return the points in order as they are on the physical strip
	//The key value indexes are relative to the start of the fixture.  A parent fixture
	//can modify keys but must keep the values the same as they are globally unique.
